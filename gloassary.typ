    description: "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field focused on the design and use of computer technology, emphasizing the interfaces between people (users) and computers. Researchers in HCI observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways. Key aspects of HCI include:
     1. Usability: Ensuring that computer systems are easy to use and efficient.
     2. User Experience (UX): Creating positive experiences for users through design.
     3. Accessibility: Making technology usable for people with a wide range of abilities.
     4. Interaction Design: Crafting the interactive aspects of a system, such as buttons, menus, and other controls.
     5. User-Centered Design: Involving users in the design process to ensure the product meets their needs.
    HCI combines principles from computer science, cognitive psychology, design, and several other fields to improve the interaction between users and computers.",
