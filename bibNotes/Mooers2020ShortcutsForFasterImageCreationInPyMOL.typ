PyMOL is a tool for generating images of biomolecular structures,
offering extensive control over their appearance through numerous
parameters#index[PyMOL]. 
To enhance and simplify its use, 241 Python functions,
termed "shortcuts," were developed #index[shortcuts]. These shortcuts, organized into 25
functional groups, allow users to perform tasks such as creating new
molecular representations, saving files with unique time-stamped names,
and conducting web searches directly from PyMOL.

To streamline and enhance user interactions with PyMOL, 241 Python
functions, known as "shortcuts," were developed. These shortcuts,
categorized into 25 functional groups, facilitate tasks such as creating
innovative molecular representations, saving files with unique
time-stamped names to prevent overwriting, and conducting web searches
directly from PyMOL. The help function provides documentation and
reusable PyMOL commands, significantly improving user efficiency by
reducing the time spent searching for code fragments. This integration
of shortcuts exemplifies the synergy between molecular graphics and
user-friendly interfaces, optimizing the workflow for researchers and
scientists. This is an excellent of good #gls("hci").
