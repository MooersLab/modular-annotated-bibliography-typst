"""
Purpose: read the strings from the file "paperAboutCoding.md" and write them in a useful format to "citations.typ

This script defines a function format_citations() that takes a list of strings and formats each string according to your specified format. 
This script includes error handling to check if the file paperAboutCoding.md exists. 
If the file is not found, it prints an error message and proceeds with an empty list of strings.
This script includes the create_bib_notes_file function, which ensures that a new file is created in the ./bibNotes directory 
if it does not already exist, with the specified content on the first line.

This script takes the input and output filenames as command line arguments. 
You can run it from the command line like this:

python script.py paperAboutCoding.md citations.typ
