Quickstart:

python mdList2typList.py papersAboutCoding.md citations.typ

Purpose: Read a list of citekeys as strings from the file "papersAboutCoding.md", 
reformat for use in the master main.typ file, and write them to "citations.tex".
The approach supports customizing the order of the entries in the annotated bibliography.
This list of citekeys can be ordered by categories instead of alphabetical order.

The script is run from the command line and takes two arguments: 
the filename of the list of citekeys and the filename of the typst output file.

This script contains two functions called from the `if __main__` section below.
The first function `format_citations()` takes a list of strings from an itemized list in LaTeX and 
formats each string to enable the inclusion of the associated bibliographic entry in the subsection heading 
and the bibNote in the annotation below.

This script includes error handling to check if the file papersAboutCoding.tex exists. 
If the file is not found, it prints an error message and proceeds with an empty list of strings.
This script includes the `create_bib_notes_file()` function, 
which creates a new file in the ./bibNotes (or ~/bibNotes) directory, 
if it does not already exist.

This script takes the input and output filenames as command line arguments. 
Run it from the command line like this:

python script.py papersAboutCoding.tex citations.tex
